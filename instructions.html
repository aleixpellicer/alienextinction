	            <p>The player controls a spaceship facing right and he must avoid or destroy enemies coming from the right side of the screen towards him. There are three kinds of enemies, each one of them with a different kind of movement pattern and weaponry. Whenever the player’s spaceship collides with an enemy or one of its missile it looses a unit of its shield. If the player’s spaceship has no more shield units when it’s hit, it will explode and the player will loose a life. When the spaceship explodes it will reappear if the player has still some “life” left, if he doesn’t the game is over. After such a resurrection the spaceship will be granted a temporary immunity for 3 seconds.

				The first kind of enemy is the most frequent, we shall call them “minions”. They move in a straight line. They will not fire any missiles.

				The second kind of enemy are a little bit more resistent and move in a less predictable way, we will call them “brainy”. They will fire a missiles in at a random rate.

				The last kind are some sort of “end level boss”. They are bigger and stronger but also far less frequent than the two other two types. They don’t move much but fire rapid missiles. When one of these appears no more enemies will appear until you’ve destroyed it.

				This game will have no end, no score and will be totally random.</p>
